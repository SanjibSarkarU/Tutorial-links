# How do I install a .whl file in a PyCharm virtualenv?
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39791243/how-do-i-install-a-whl-file-in-a-pycharm-virtualenv

To install via your command line, and avoid installing on your base Python, you'll have to first activate the virtualenv.

You can do this on POSIX using:

$ source path_to_your_venv/bin/activate
And then for Windows systems:

> path_to_venv\Scripts\activate
You can then install the .whl file with pip install filename.whl while the virtual env has been activated.

For Pycharm venv's the path is 'path_to_venv/Scripts/activate.bat â€“
